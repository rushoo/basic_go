Map is like a Go map[interface{}]interface{} but is safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines without additional locking or coordination.   
Loads, stores, and deletes run in amortized constant time.  
   
The Map type is specialized. Most code should use a plain Go map instead,with separate locking or coordination, for better type safety and to make it   
easier to maintain other invariants along with the map content.   
   
The Map type is optimized for two common use cases:    
(1) when the entry for a given key is only ever written once but read many times, as in caches that only grow, or    
(2) when multiple goroutines read, write, and overwrite entries for disjoint sets of keys.    
In these two cases, use of a Map may significantly reduce lock contention compared to a Go map paired with a separate Mutex or RWMutex.    

The zero Map is empty and ready for use. A Map must not be copied after first use.   

In the terminology of the Go memory model, Map arranges that a write operation “synchronizes before” any read operation that observes the effect of the write,   
where read and write operations are defined as follows.
Load, LoadAndDelete, LoadOrStore are read operations;   
Delete, LoadAndDelete, and Store are write operations;    
and LoadOrStore is a write operation when it returns loaded set to false.   

```
type Map struct {
	mu Mutex

	// read contains the portion of the map's contents that are safe for
	// concurrent access (with or without mu held).
	//
	// The read field itself is always safe to load, but must only be stored with
	// mu held.
	//
	// Entries stored in read may be updated concurrently without mu, but updating
	// a previously-expunged entry requires that the entry be copied to the dirty
	// map and unexpunged with mu held.
	read atomic.Value // readOnly

	// dirty contains the portion of the map's contents that require mu to be
	// held. To ensure that the dirty map can be promoted to the read map quickly,
	// it also includes all of the non-expunged entries in the read map.
	//
	// Expunged entries are not stored in the dirty map. An expunged entry in the
	// clean map must be unexpunged and added to the dirty map before a new value
	// can be stored to it.
	//
	// If the dirty map is nil, the next write to the map will initialize it by
	// making a shallow copy of the clean map, omitting stale entries.
	dirty map[any]*entry

	// misses counts the number of loads since the read map was last updated that
	// needed to lock mu to determine whether the key was present.
	//
	// Once enough misses have occurred to cover the cost of copying the dirty
	// map, the dirty map will be promoted to the read map (in the unamended
	// state) and the next store to the map will make a new dirty copy.
	misses int
}
